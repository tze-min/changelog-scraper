# changelog-scraper
Python scrapers for getting changelog information of apps.

Written to collect data for a research project under NUS School of Computing.

Contains two scrapers:
1. Retrieves version numbers of apps in `data/apps_of_interest.csv` available in Apple App Store
2. Retrieves changelog information (version number, changelog text, date) of apps in the above csv available in App Annie

`data/sample_data.csv` is a sample dataset for a few apps' information scraped using the latter.
